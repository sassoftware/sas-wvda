# SAS Viya Deployment Assistant for Windows (sas-wvda.ps1)

## Purpose
To ease the installation process of SAS Viya 3.4 and Viya 3.5 on Microsoft Windows Server by:
* Validating pre-requisites are meet
* Validating / applying SAS Recommended tuning
* Installing SAS public certificates to facilitate execution of signed scripts
* Validating / configuring user and service principals required by the software.
* Validate encrypted passwords configured by SAS Admin
* facilitate the communication process between the SAS Admin and the domain / security admin

## [Download signed Binaries](zips/README.md)

## Audience
The primary users of sas-wvda are SAS Administrators.  

## Usage Pre-reqs
* Java 8 must be Installed
* the JAVA_HOME environment variable must be correctly set
* Powershell 5.1 must be Installed
* The user must be a local administrator of the host
* This script sas-wvda.ps1 should be executed only on a server that is intended to run SAS Viya.
* If the user is also a domain admin then additional functionality is available

## Output classification
sas-wvda produces 5 types of output messages:
* INFO: These messages are informational messages such as version information and feedback that a requirement has been verified
* WARNING: These messages indicate a requirement has not yet been met.  WARNING messages must be resolved before SAS Viya can be successfully installed.
* NOTE: These messages indicate that the deployment assistant has made a change to your environment.  This change may be creating an account, changing a tuning parameter, or adding an account to a local group.  These messages will be of interest to you from a system administrative perspective.
* ERROR: These messages indicate that a problem has occurred during processing.
* unclassified messages are generated by some commands invoked by the deployment assistant.

## Documentation
The most up-to-date documentation can be obtained from the script itself via the [Get-Help command](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/get-help?view=powershell-5.1)
for example:

`Get-Help C:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1
Get-Help C:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 -examples
Get-Help C:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 -detailed
Get-Help C:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 -full`

Note the -Verbose argument can be used to obtain detailed information in the event of unexpected results.

## Usage overview
To run this script the SAS administrator must be an administrator on the local host.  If the SAS Administrator has domain
admin privileges then the script can completely prepare a host for deployment of SAS Viya 3.4 on Windows.  This documentation will walk you through the process of preparing a server for SAS Viya installation.  There are two scenarios presented:
* User has local administrator privileges but not domain administrator privileges
* User has both local administrator and domain administrator privileges

### Pre-installation walkthrough where user is a local Admin but not a Domain Admin
If the user is a local admin but does not have domain administrative privileges the process of preparing for the installation of SAS Viya will require assistance from someone who has domain administrative privileges.  An overview of the steps includes:
* local admin runs sas-wvda to assesses the readiness of the server and remediates any issues identified
* local admin runs sas-wvda to prepare a script for the domain administrator to run.  The script will automate all actions required on the part of the domain administrator to configure all domain level entities and permissions required for SAS Viya to function.
* The local admin provides the script to their domain administrator
* The domain administrator executes the script.  At the end of the script a zip file is prepared which must be given to the local admin to continue configuration of the server that is to host SAS Viya.
* The local admin uses the content of the zip file to continue preparations for the installation of SAS Viya
* Once all WARNINGs and ERRORs are resolved the local administrator can install SAS Viya.

 The first step is to assess the basic install readiness of the host:

`c:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 -validate host`

In this example many prerequisites are not met.  None of the account entities exist.
There are system tuning requirements that are not met.:

Provide SASViyaADEntitySetup.ps1 to your Active Directory administrator.  When the script has successfully completed you will be provided:
 - The name and password of the CAS account
 - A keytab for the HTTP service principal
You must have all of these artifacts prior to deployment of SAS Viya 3.4.
NOTE: System settings have been updated which require a restart to become effective
      This system must be restarted prior to installing SAS Viya!
```
**Take care to follow the instruction at the end and reboot if instructed to do so otherwise SAS Viya will not successfully install and start**

Provide the SASViyaADEntitySetup.ps1 script to your domain administrator.

Once the domain administrator has executed the script and provided the ViyaAdminInfo.zip file you will need to extract the contents.  Place the keytab file in the location of your choosing.  Use the content of the ViyaAdminREADME.txt file to understand the actions taken on your behalf.  You will also need the name of the CAS service account as well as the password to prepare for the SAS Viya deployment.

Sample content from a ViyaAdminREADME.txt file:
```
Actions Completed by domain admin helper script:

The CAS Service Account (ADPERF\cas) was successfully created with password: %1N;^yt-!o}g+kztpg-q
The HTTP service account (ADPERF\WIN2016D-HTT) was created successfully.
The HTTP keytab (http-WIN2016D.keytab) was successfully created.
      Targeting domain controller: win2012.ad.perf.sas.com
      Password successfully set!
```
Once the keytab is copied to the desired location and the passwords provided for the postgres and cas accounts are used to create the encrypted user files it is time to run the deployment assistant again to complete configuration on the local host and to ensure all the local rights and group memberships are configured.

Because there are no WARNINGs SAS Viya can be successfully deployed on this host.  For specific instructions on these steps refer to the __SAS Viya on Windows: Deployment Guide__ for your version of SAS Viya software.

### Pre-installation walkthrough where user is Domain Admin
If the user is both a local admin and domain admin the first step is to assess the basic install readiness of the host:

`c:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 -validate host`

In this example many prerequisites are not met.  None of the account entities exist.
There are system tuning requirements that are not met.:

After installing the required redistributable packages from Microsoft run the script again.  In this walkthrough we have Domain Admin privileges so we are able to create entities in Active Directory as well as on the local host.  To create all accounts with specified names, grant permissions, and create a keytab invoke the deployment assistant as follows:

`c:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 c:\path\to\ViyaHTTP.keytab -Validate host -SvcAcctPrefix "" -PostgresAcct "postgres" -CasAcct "cas" -CreateADEntities -CreateKeytab -Remediate`
```

Here we see that accounts have been created for CAS, PostrgreSQL, and the passwords for those accounts have been displayed in the tool output.  Note that a service account has also been created for the HTTP service on this host.  If there had been a desire to specify the passwords for these accounts the -CASPassword and -PostgresPassword arguments could have been used to specify those on the command invocation.

Now execute the command one final time to ensure all rights have been assigned to the accounts created above.  This time we do not need the -CreateADEntities and -CreateKeytab arguments

In this scenario there are no WARNING or ERROR messages.  The host is now prepared to host a SAS Viya deployment.  For specific instructions on these steps refer to the __SAS Viya on Windows: Deployment Guide__ for your version of SAS Viya software.

## Behavior
If a SAS Administrator has both local and domain admin privileges on the server and network where SAS is to be installed the script can perform the following actions from one invocation:

`c:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 c:\path\to\ViyaHTTP.keytab -validate host -createADEntities -remediate -createKeytab`

will:
* Validate the script is executing in a 64-bit environment
* Validate the version of PowerShell meets or exceeds the minimum requirement
* Validate the installation is running on Windows Server
* Validate that the version of Windows Server meets or exceeds the minimum requirement
* Validate that the 64-bit Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable is installed
* Validate that the 64-bit Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable is installed
* Ensure required modules are installed
* Validate that the server's computer account is trusted for delegation / remediate if not
* Validate that the casspn/<hostname> Service Principal Name (SPN) is defined
	* If the SPN is not defined in Active Directory (AD) searches for an account that matches the default name
	* If the default account exists ensure all required permissions are configured and associate the SPN
	* If the default account does not exist - Create it with required attributes - assigning a random password and associate the SPN with the account - report the new password to the user
	* Ensure the domain account:
		* Is in the local Administrators group
		* Has the "Log on as a service" right
		* Has the "Replace a process level token" right
* Validate that the HTTP/<hostname> Service Principal Name (SPN) is defined
	* If the SPN is not defined in Active Directory (AD) searches for an account that matches the default name
	* If the default account exists ensure all required permissions are configured and associate the SPN
	* If the default account does not exist - Create it with required attributes - assigning a random password and associate the SPN with the account
* Create a keytab for the HTTP/<hostname> SPN named c:\path\to\ViyaHTTP.keytab
* Validate the keytab
* Validate the local postgres service account
	* Exists
	* Is a member of the local Users Group
	* Has the "Log on as a service" right
* Validate / Remediate SharedSection Tuning
* Validate / Remediate TcpTimedWaitDelay value
* Validate / Remediate Win32PrioritySeparation value
* Validate / Remediate the TCP Dynamic Port range configuration meets SAS recommendations
* Validate / Remediate the presence of SAS Public certificates used to validate signed scripts during install and execution of SAS Viya.

If a SAS Administrator has local admin privileges but not domain admin privileges then a command such as:

`c:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 c:\sas\ViyaHTTP.keytab -validate host -createADEntities -cmdFileOnly -remediate -createKeytab`

will:
* Validate the script is executing in a 64-bit environment
* Validate the version of PowerShell meets or exceeds the minimum requirement
* Validate the installation is running on Windows Server
* Validate that the version of Windows Server meets or exceeds the minimum requirement
* Validate that the 64-bit Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable is installed
* Validate that the 64-bit Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable is installed
* Ensure required modules are installed
* Create a new domain-admin-helper PowerShell script that contains commands to remediate any of the following Validations that fail:
	* Validate that the server's computer account is trusted for delegation / remediate if not
	* Validate that the sascas/<hostname> Service Principal Name (SPN) is defined
		* If the SPN is not defined in Active Directory (AD) searches for an account that matches the default name
		* If the default account exists ensure all required permissions are configured and associate the SPN
		* If the default account does not exist - Create it with required attributes - assigning a random password and associate the SPN with the account - report the new password to the user
		* Ensure the domain account:
			* Is in the local Administrators group
			* Has the "Log on as a service" right
			* Has the "Replace a process level token" right
	* Validate that the HTTP/<hostname> Service Principal Name (SPN) is defined
		* If the SPN is not defined in Active Directory (AD) searches for an account that matches the default name
		* If the default account exists ensure all required permissions are configured and associate the SPN
		* If the default account does not exist - Create it with required attributes - assigning a random password and associate the SPN with the account
	* Create a keytab for the HTTP/<hostname> SPN named c:\path\to\ViyaHTTP.keytab
* Validate the local postgres service account
	* Create if doesn't exist
	* If not a member of the local Users Group - add to local Users group
	* If does not have the "Log on as a service" right - grant the right
* Validate / Remediate SharedSection Tuning
* Validate / Remediate TcpTimedWaitDelay value
* Validate / Remediate Win32PrioritySeparation value
* Validate / Remediate the TCP Dynamic Port range configuration meets SAS recommendations
* Validate / Remediate the presence of SAS Public certificates used to validate signed scripts during install and execution of SAS Viya.

The default location for the generated script is the current working directory.  The default name for the script is SASViyaADEntitySetup.ps1
The path and name of the script can be changed by using the -cmdFilePath argument followed by the path and filename desired.

The script can be used immediately prior to the deployment of SAS Viya in validate and report only mode by:

`c:\path\to\sas-wvda.ps1 c:\sas\ViyaHTTP.keytab -deployDir c:\path\to\powershell-deployment`

If -deployDir is not specified then the current working directory is assumed to contain the encrypted password xml files.  In addition to all the validation listed above this invocation will also perform the following validations:
* The postgresUser.xml file contains a valid username and password combination
* The casUser.xml file contains a valid username and password combination
* The username in the casUser.xml file matches the account name associated with the sascas/<hostname> SPN

## Planned enhancements
* After release: use the zip file created by the domain-admin-helper PowerShell script to create and validate the required encrypted credential xml files
* After release: handle the backup service account as the CAS account is currently handled
* After release: Provide the ability to periodically update passwords on the domain accounts and refresh the HTTP SPN's keytab
* After release: perform common troubleshooting for other configuration items that can go wrong such as invalid configuration of the Kerberos properties via SAS Environment Manager
